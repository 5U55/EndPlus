# End Plus
This mod adds some more life to the desolate wasteland that is The Outer End with 3 new structures and 1 new biome.

# End Temple
Left behind by worshipers of an Ender Dragon these structures are guarded by Enderman Brutes who, although they may appear similar to Enderman at first glance, are stronger, faster and most importantly, always hostile. The brutes spawn out of two spawners located on the statue in the middle of the upper floor of the temple. This statue also contain a single diamond block, and if you venture into the lower floor of the temple there are also two chest filled with loot.

# Ender Dragon Skeletons
Occasionally you may stumble upon the skeleton of a long dead Ender Dragon, buried in the bones you will find an Ender Chest, free for the taking.

# End Decay Biome
Portions of large end islands are now made up of blackstone and infested with bats

# Main Island Ruins
The location of a fight with a dragon long ago. Ruined End Spike towers filled with treasure chests surrounding a broken exit portal can occasionally be found in the outer End.
